<li>Learn how to make data systems scalable to support web or mobile apps with millions of users.</li>
<li>Make applications higly available and operationally robust.</li>
<li>Find ways of making systems easier to maintina in the long run, enven as they grow and as requirements and technologies change.</li>
<li>Know what goes on inside major websites and online services.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Reliable-Scalable-and-Maintainable"><a href="#Reliable-Scalable-and-Maintainable" class="headerlink" title="Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable"></a>Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable</h4><p>Many applications today are dat-intensive, as opposed to compute-intensive. Raw CPU power is rarely a limiting factor for these applications- bigger problems are usually the amount of data, the complexity of data, and the speed at which it is changing.</p>
<p>Data Intensive funcationality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database: Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later.</li>
<li>Caches: Remember the result of an expensive operation to speed up reads.</li>
<li>Search Indexes: Allow users to search data by keyword or filter in various ways.</li>
<li>Stream Processing: Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously</li>
<li>Batch Processing: Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Reliability"><a href="#Reliability" class="headerlink" title="Reliability"></a>Reliability</h5><p>The System should continue to work correctly (performing the correct fucntion at the desired level of performance) even in the face of adversity （hardware or software faults, and even human error). <br></p>
<p><strong>Software Expections (working correctly, continueing to work correctly, even when things go wrong.)</strong> <br></p>
<ul>
<li>The application performs the function that the user expected.</li>
<li>It can tolerate the suer making mistakes or using the software in unexpected ways.</li>
<li>Its performance is good enough for the required use case, under the expected load and data volumn.</li>
<li>The system prevents any unauthorized access and abuse.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Faults</em>, is usually defined as one component of the system deviating from its expectation.<br></p>
<p><em>Fault-tolerant</em>, systems anticipate faults and can cop with them, because of the limited budget, the systems can only handle certain types of faults.<br></p>
<p><em>Failure</em>, it is when the system as a whole stops providing the required service to the suer. It’s possible to reduce the probaility of a failure to 0, but not fault.<br></p>
<p><strong>Hardware Faults</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hard disks crash -&gt; RAID configuration</li>
<li>Power grid has a blackout -&gt; dual power supplies</li>
<li>RAM and CPU become faulty -&gt; hot-swappable RAM and CPU</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Software Errors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A software bug that causes every instanceo f an pplication server to crash when given a particular bad input.</li>
<li>A runaway process that uses up some shared resource such as CPU, memory, disk, or network bandwidth.</li>
<li>A service that the system depends on that slows down, becomes unresponsive, or starts returning corruptecd resonses.</li>
<li>Cascading failures, where a small fault in one component triggers a fault in another component, which in turn triggers further faults.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no quick solution to the problem of systematic faults in softwares:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Carefully thinking about assumptions and interactions in the system</li>
<li>Thorough testing</li>
<li>Process isolation</li>
<li>Allowing processes to crash and restart</li>
<li>Measureing, monitoring, and analyzing system behavior in production.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Human Errors</strong></p>
<p>Congiruation errors by operators were the leading cause of errors. Even when they have the best intentions, humans are known to be unreliable. Some approaches should be considered to reduce human errors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Design a restrictive system in a way that minimizes opportunities for error.</li>
<li>Decouple the places where people make the most mistakes from the palces where they can cause failures.</li>
<li>Test thoroughly at all levels, from unit tests to whole-system integration tests and manual tests. Automated testing is widely used, well understood, and especially valuable for covering corner cases that rarely arise in normal operation. </li>
<li>Allow quick and easy recovery from human errors, to minimize the impact in the case of a failure.</li>
<li>Set up detailed and clear monitoring, such as performance metrices and error rates. In other engineering disciplines this is referred to as <strong>telemetry</strong>. </li>
<li>Implement good management practices and training</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Scalability"><a href="#Scalability" class="headerlink" title="Scalability"></a>Scalability</h5><p>As the system grows (in data volume, traffice volume, or complexity), these should be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth.<br></p>
<p>Scalability is the term we use to describe a system’s ability to cope with increased load. Consider questions: “If the system grows in a particular way, what are our options for coping with the growth?” and “How can we add computing resources to handle the additional load?”</p>
<p><strong>Describing Load</strong> <br><br>Load can be described with a few numbers which we call load parameters: <br> </p>
<ul>
<li>Request per second to a web server</li>
<li>The ratio of reads to writes in a database.</li>
<li>The number of simultaneously active users in a chat room</li>
<li>The hit rate on a cache</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Descreibing performance</strong> <br></p>
<ul>
<li>When you increase a load parameter and keep the system resources unchanged, how is the performance of your system affected?</li>
<li>WHen you increase a load parameter, how much do you need to increase the resources if you want to keep the performance unchanged? </li>
</ul>
<p>We need to think of response time not as a single number, but as a distribution of values that you can measure. It’s common to see the average response time of a service reported. (Strictly speaking, the term “average” doesn’t refer to any particular formular, but in practice it is usually understood as the arithmetic mean: given n values, andd up all the valuess, and divide by n.) <br></p>
<p>Usually, it is better to use percentiles which could find median (50th), the tail latencie for important users who has more data (99th), or the best one (1th). <br></p>
<p>Also, percentiles are often used in service level objective(SLOs)and service level agreements(SLAs), contracts that define the expected performance and availability of a service. <br></p>
<p>As a server can only process a small number of things in parallel, it only takes a small number of slow requests to hold up the processing of subsequent requests - an affect sometimes known as head-of-line blocking. Hence, it is important to <em>measure response time on the client side</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Approaches for Coping with Load</strong></p>
<p>Architecture</p>
<ul>
<li>Scaling up (vertical sacling, moving to a more powerful machine)</li>
<li>Scaling out (horizontal scaling, distributing the load across multiple smaller machines). </li>
</ul>
<p>In sum, several fairly powerful machines can still be simpler and cheaper than a large number of small Virtual machines. There is no such thing as a generic, one-size-fits-all scalable architecture. <br> </p>
<p>Some systems are elastic, meaning that they can automatically add computing<br>resources when they detect a load increase, whereas other systems are scaled manually.<br></p>
<h5 id="Maintainability"><a href="#Maintainability" class="headerlink" title="Maintainability"></a>Maintainability</h5><p>Over time, many different people will work on the system (engineering and operations, both maintaining current behavior and adapting the system to new use cases), and they should all be able to work on it _productively.<br></p>
<p>It is well known that the majority of the cost of software is not in its initial development, but in its ongoing maintenance. <br></p>
<ul>
<li>fix bugs</li>
<li>keeping its systems operational</li>
<li>investigating failures</li>
<li>adapting it to new platforms</li>
<li>modifying it for new use cases</li>
<li>repaying technical debt</li>
<li>adding new features</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people working on software systems dislike maintenance of “legacy systems” that could be avoided by 3 design principles: <br></p>
<p><strong>Operability</strong> <br><br>Make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running smootthly. <br></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring the health of the system and quickly restoring service if it goes into a bad state</li>
<li>Tracking down the cause of problems, such as system failures or degraded performance</li>
<li>Keeping software and platforms up to date, including security patches</li>
<li>Keeping tabs on how different systems affect each other, so that a problematic change can be avoided before it causes damage</li>
<li>Anticipating future problems and solving them before they occur</li>
<li>Establishing good practices and tools for deployment, configuration management, and more</li>
<li>performing complex maintenance tasks, such as moving an application from one platform to another</li>
<li>Maintaining the security of the system as configuration changes are made</li>
<li>Defining processes that make operations predictable and help keep the production envionment stable</li>
<li>Preserving the organization’s knowledge about the system, even as individual people come and go</li>
</ul>
<p>Good operability means making routine tasks easy, allowing the operations team to focus their efforts on high-value activities. Data systems can do various things to make routine tasks easy, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing visibility into the runtime behavior and internals of the system, with good monitoring</li>
<li>Providing good support for automation and integration with standard tools</li>
<li>Avoiding dependency on individual machines (allowing machines to be taken<br>down for maintenance while the system as a whole continues running uninterrupted)</li>
<li>Providing good documentation and an easy-to-understand operational model (“If I do X, Y will happen”)</li>
<li>Providing good default behavior, but also giving administrators the freedom to<br>override defaults when needed</li>
<li>Self-healing where appropriate, but also giving administrators manual control<br>over the system state when needed</li>
<li>Exhibiting predictable behavior, minimizing surprises</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong> <br><br>Make it easy for new engineers to understand the system by removing as much as complexity as possible from the system. A software project mired in complexity is described as a big ball of mud. <br> </p>
<p>Making a system simpler does not necessarily mean reducing its functionality. it can also mean removing accidental complexity. <br></p>
<p><strong>Evolvability (extensibility, modifiability, plasticity)</strong><br><br>Make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the feature, adapting it for unanticipated use cases as requirements changes. <br></p>
<p>Agile working patterns provide a framework for adapting to change. The Agile community has also developed technical tools and patterns that are helpful when developing software in frequently changing environment, such as test-driven development (TDD) and refactoring.</p>
<h6 id="In-Sum"><a href="#In-Sum" class="headerlink" title="In Sum"></a>In Sum</h6><p>Reliability means making systems work correctly, even when faults occur. <br><br>Scalability means having strategies for keeping performance good, even when load<br>increases.<br><br>Maintainability has many facets, but in essence it’s about making life better for the engineering and operations teams who need to work with the system. <br></p>
